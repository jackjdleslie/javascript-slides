# The Weird Parts of JavaScript

> An introduction to JavaScript on the web and an explanation of JavaScript versions and why we need tools like Babel

#### Outline

Often people new to JavaScript, myself included, try to start a project with some new framework like React and are met with lots of intimidating configuration files from Webpack, Babel and co. Why is so much config needed for a language that was inherently designed for the web when creating web apps?

In this talk, I give a brief history of JavaScript versioning and how the JavaScript language evolves. I explain the reasoning for the config in web development and why tools like Babel are needed when we're programming using the hot new JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
