# JavaScript Demystified

### A re-introduction to JavaScript

---

<Layout title="Who are you?" />

<Notes>

- I'm just curious to see your thoughts on JavaScript and your experience with it
- How many of you have never used JavaScript before?
- How many of you have used it and either not liked it or are confused by it?
- How many of you use it and like it?

<Layout title="Why?">

- JavaScript has a weird history, and a confusing versioning process
- Especially since we're more used to Java, which has very obvious versioning and target
- But once you've grasped JavaScript, you can use JavaScript anywhere

</Layout>

<Notes>

Weird history and confusing versioning process
- Without understanding where it came from, it kind of seems like JavaScript came from nowhere and just happens
to be supported everywhere inconsistently, but there are reasons for this.
- Also, why is it called JavaScript? And come to think of it, what version is JavaScript and what version am I using
when I use Node?
- This is all stuff that doesn't directly need answered when writing JavaScript, but helps so much when you
know what's going on.

We are more used to Java
- At uni, we've all used Java. Whatever you think of the Java language, it has a pretty straight forward versioning process and target.
Every major update of Java bumps the version number up, and when you compile Java you are targeting the JVM - simple. Java is like PS3 -> PS4 -> PS5,
JavaScript is like Xbox One S -> Xbox One X -> Xbox Series X

JavaScript anywhere
- Once you know what JavaScript is, and what you're targeting when you're writing in different environments, you can
write a full stack in one language.
- Regardless of how you feel about the language itself, it's a great thing to know if you want to iterate quickly or create an MVP,
and is amazing for hackathons.

<Layout title="A history of JS">

- Netscape thought HTML needed a "glue language" to add interactivity to web pages
- They added LiveScript to Netscape Navigator in 1995
- They changed the name to JavaScript to build up hype and compete with Microsoft
- In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA to form a standard specification for other browsers to use
- In 1997, ECMA-262 was published.

</Layout>

<Notes>

Netscape "glue language"
- Various languages were considered for this. 
- Netscape actually collaborated with Sun Microsystems who were developing Java
to make it the scripting language for browsers
- The original creator of JavaScript was originally contracted to
integrate Scheme into Netscape.

LiveScript
- This has a similar syntax to Java, and would help drive more developers to use this rather than Microsoft
- A key feature of the language was keeping it as open as possible, not focusing on any particular paradigm

JavaScript
- They decided to fully steer into the Java hype and really wanted to compete with Microsoft, even though
it doesn't really have anything to do with Java other than some similar syntax back in the day

ECMA
- To promote the usage of JavaScript and steer away from proprietary browser languages, Netscape submitted JavaScript
to the ECMA (European association for standardizing information and communication systems) to get standardised.

ECMA-262
- It was published as a standard in 1997, ECMAScript is a specification for building a language that is supported by
all major browsers.
