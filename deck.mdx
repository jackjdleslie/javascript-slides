# JavaScript Demystified

### A re-introduction to JavaScript

---

<Layout title="Who are you?" />

<Notes>

- I'm just curious to see your thoughts on JavaScript and your experience with it
- How many of you have never used JavaScript before?
- How many of you have used it and either not liked it or are confused by it?
- How many of you use it and like it?

</Notes>

<Layout title="Why?">

- JavaScript has a weird history, and a confusing versioning process
- Especially since we're more used to Java, which has very obvious versioning and target
- But once you've grasped JavaScript, you can use JavaScript anywhere

</Layout>

<Notes>

Weird history and confusing versioning process
- Without understanding where it came from, it kind of seems like JavaScript came from nowhere and just happens
to be supported everywhere inconsistently, but there are reasons for this.
- Also, why is it called JavaScript? And come to think of it, what version is JavaScript and what version am I using
when I use Node?
- This is all stuff that doesn't directly need answered when writing JavaScript, but helps so much when you
know what's going on.

We are more used to Java
- At uni, we've all used Java. Whatever you think of the Java language, it has a pretty straight forward versioning process and target.
Every major update of Java bumps the version number up, and when you compile Java you are targeting the JVM - simple. Java is like PS3 -> PS4 -> PS5,
JavaScript is like Xbox One S -> Xbox One X -> Xbox Series X

JavaScript anywhere
- Once you know what JavaScript is, and what you're targeting when you're writing in different environments, you can
write a full stack in one language.
- Regardless of how you feel about the language itself, it's a great thing to know if you want to iterate quickly or create an MVP,
and is amazing for hackathons.

<Layout title="A history of JS">

- Netscape thought HTML needed a "glue language" to add interactivity to web pages
- They added LiveScript to Netscape Navigator in 1995
- They changed the name to JavaScript to build up hype and compete with Microsoft
- In 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA to form a standard specification for other browsers to use
- In 1997, ECMA-262 was published.

</Layout>

<Notes>

Netscape "glue language"
- Various languages were considered for this. 
- Netscape actually collaborated with Sun Microsystems who were developing Java
to make it the scripting language for browsers
- The original creator of JavaScript was originally contracted to
integrate Scheme into Netscape.

LiveScript
- This has a similar syntax to Java, and would help drive more developers to use this rather than Microsoft
- A key feature of the language was keeping it as open as possible, not focusing on any particular paradigm

JavaScript
- They decided to fully steer into the Java hype and really wanted to compete with Microsoft, even though
it doesn't really have anything to do with Java other than some similar syntax back in the day

ECMA
- To promote the usage of JavaScript and steer away from proprietary browser languages, Netscape submitted JavaScript
to the ECMA (European association for standardizing information and communication systems) to get standardised.

ECMA-262
- It was published as a standard in 1997, ECMAScript is a specification for building a language that is supported by
all major browsers.

EXAMPLE
The ECMAScript specification: https://tc39.es/ecma262/

<Layout title="How JS works">

- JavaScript is a scripting language, you are going to act on an existing entity
- This entity is the JavaScript runtime that you choose to target
- The JavaScript runtime can be the browser, or can be server-side
- In the browser, you are interacting with APIs provided by the browser, e.g document
- In the server, you are interacting with APIs provided by Node.js, e.g file system

</Layout>

<Notes>

JavaScript is a scripting language
- The reason you want to use JavaScript is because you want to interact with some existing
entity through some APIs.

JavaScript runtime
- When we say entity, we're referring to the JavaScript runtime that we're going to use.
- This runtime is going to provide APIs for us to interact with

Browser or server-side
- Depending on which runtime we choose, we'll get a different set of APIs
- If you're a front-end developer, you're working with APIs provided by browsers
- If you're a back-end developer, you're working with APIs provided by the server-side environment

Browser
- Browsers provide a lot of APIs to work with, the most common ones being document and window
- For example, perform some scripting functionality when a document has loaded

Server
- To work outside of the browser, we use Node.js.
- There are no web pages to work with on the server side, so we don't get access to things like document or window
- Instead, we get APIs for things like the file system, or to work with network protocols like http

</Notes>

<Layout title="How JS works: in the browser">

- When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM)
- The HTML DOM defines the HTML elements as a tree of objects
- The browser provides the <code>document</code> interface to interact with the DOM tree
- With JavaScript you can change the content and style of HTML elements
- You can also react to HTML DOM events, e.g on a button click perform some action

</Layout>

<Notes>

TODO: add script for this section

EXAMPLE: get element with yellow background and change to red
